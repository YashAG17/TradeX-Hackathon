# Bot-aware Market Surveillance in Simulated AMM Trading

This project is a simulation environment for reinforcement learning and decision intelligence. It is not a trading bot, DeFi product, wallet, liquidity manager, or blockchain integration demo.

The environment models an AMM-style market and asks an agent to act as a market surveillance controller. At each step, the agent reviews structured signals about recent trading activity and chooses one of four responses:

- `ALLOW`
- `FLAG`
- `BLOCK`
- `MONITOR`

The goal is to identify suspicious bot-like behavior while minimizing harm to normal users and preserving healthy market behavior.

## For Judges

This repository is intended to be evaluated in deterministic competition mode.

- Use the root [inference.py](/home/casp1an/Code/TradeX1/inference.py) as the submission entrypoint.
- Use the repo-root [Dockerfile](/home/casp1an/Code/TradeX1/Dockerfile) and repo-root [openenv.yaml](/home/casp1an/Code/TradeX1/openenv.yaml) as the primary submission artifacts.
- Provide the required model environment variables: `API_BASE_URL`, `MODEL_NAME`, and `HF_TOKEN`.
- Run with `EVAL_MODE=true` and `DEMO_MODE=false` so the environment uses a fixed seed and produces reproducible scores.
- Treat the LLM-driven policy as the official baseline path.
- Treat the heuristic policy only as a crash fallback and internal testing aid, not as the intended submitted baseline.

This matches the project’s intended hackathon evaluation flow: a single inference entrypoint, deterministic task execution, and programmatic grading across all tasks.

## What The Benchmark Measures

This benchmark is designed as a real-world surveillance and anomaly-detection task:

- detect suspicious bursts of trading activity
- detect repeated manipulation patterns
- avoid false positives on normal activity
- avoid false negatives on harmful activity
- preserve healthy market participation

The benchmark is reward-shaped for partial progress. It does not optimize for profit.

## Observation Space

Each step returns a fixed-size structured observation with surveillance signals:

- `current_amm_price`
- `liquidity_snapshot`
- `recent_trade_count`
- `trades_in_window`
- `trade_frequency`
- `average_trade_size`
- `maximum_trade_size`
- `recent_slippage_impact`
- `time_gap_mean`
- `time_gap_min`
- `recent_time_gaps`
- `recent_price_impacts`
- `burst_indicator`
- `pattern_indicator`
- `suspiciousness_score`
- `manipulation_score`

## Action Space

Only these actions are valid:

- `ALLOW`
- `FLAG`
- `BLOCK`
- `MONITOR`

Legacy trading and liquidity-management actions have been removed from the environment logic.

## Reward Logic

Reward combines:

- positive reward for correctly detecting suspicious behavior
- positive reward for correctly allowing normal activity
- false positive penalties
- false negative penalties
- severity bonuses on harmful suspicious activity
- overblocking penalties to protect healthy market behavior

## Tasks

The repo includes three deterministic tasks with distinct difficulty levels:

1. `burst_detection`
2. `pattern_manipulation_detection`
3. `full_market_surveillance`

- `burst_detection`: learn to catch abrupt high-frequency bursts.
- `pattern_manipulation_detection`: learn repeated timing and size signatures.
- `full_market_surveillance`: balance burst detection, pattern detection, and false-positive control in mixed traffic.

## Baseline Policies

The official competition baseline is the LLM-driven policy in [inference.py](/home/casp1an/Code/TradeX1/inference.py). It uses the OpenAI client together with the required environment variables:

- `API_BASE_URL`
- `MODEL_NAME`
- `HF_TOKEN`

The rule-based heuristic in [meverse/baseline_policy.py](/home/casp1an/Code/TradeX1/meverse/baseline_policy.py) is kept for two narrower jobs:

- crash fallback if the LLM call fails
- benchmark comparison to test whether the environment has headroom beyond simple thresholds

It is not the intended submitted baseline. It exists to support internal testing, benchmark analysis, and graceful degradation if the upstream model call fails during a run.

The heuristic policy follows simple surveillance rules:

- if pattern score is high and slippage is high, `BLOCK`
- elif manipulation score is high, `BLOCK`
- elif burst score or trade frequency is high, `FLAG`
- elif suspiciousness is moderate, `MONITOR`
- else `ALLOW`

## Running The Environment

Serve the OpenEnv app from the repo root:

```bash
python app.py
```

Validate the environment package directly:

```bash
openenv validate
```

## Running Inference

The root inference runner is [inference.py](/home/casp1an/Code/TradeX1/inference.py). It loads the surveillance environment, runs the LLM baseline, and prints clean competition-style logs. If the upstream model call fails, it falls back to the heuristic policy so the run can still complete.

```bash
python inference.py
```

Optional task selection:

```powershell
$env:MEVERSE_TASK="full_market_surveillance"
python inference.py
```

## Required Environment Variables

`inference.py` reads these variables:

- `API_BASE_URL`
- `MODEL_NAME`
- `HF_TOKEN`
- `EVAL_MODE`
- `DEMO_MODE`

Example PowerShell setup:

```powershell
$env:API_BASE_URL="https://router.huggingface.co/v1"
$env:MODEL_NAME="gpt-4o-mini"
$env:HF_TOKEN="your-token"
python inference.py
```

If `HF_TOKEN` is not set, the script cannot use the primary LLM baseline and will label the run as `heuristic-fallback`. For submission, the required API variables should be present. The fallback exists to reduce crash risk, not as the intended submitted baseline.

Mode behavior:

- `EVAL_MODE=true` is the official judging mode. The environment resets with a fixed seed so the observation sequence is deterministic and scores are reproducible across runs.
- `DEMO_MODE=true` is an exploratory mode for local testing only. It introduces small bounded variation into the scenario so contributors can sanity-check that the policy is not overfitting one exact replay.
- `DEMO_MODE=true` takes precedence over `EVAL_MODE`, so it should not be used when reporting baseline scores or when preparing a competition submission.
- Judges should evaluate the project with `EVAL_MODE=true` and `DEMO_MODE=false`.

## Validation And Graders

Validation logic is implemented in [meverse/validation.py](/home/casp1an/Code/TradeX1/meverse/validation.py). It:

- enumerates all tasks
- runs each task independently
- runs the deterministic grader independently
- prints task-wise scores
- asserts every score satisfies `0.0 <= score <= 1.0`

Run it with:

```bash
python -m meverse.validation
```

To compare the heuristic policy against the official LLM baseline and check whether the environment is too shallow, run:

```bash
python compare_policies.py
```

That script is analysis tooling for benchmark quality. It is not the competition inference entrypoint.

## Verifying Score Range

When you run the validation suite, each task prints a normalized score and the script asserts the range check `0.0 <= score <= 1.0`.

## OpenEnv Metadata

Project metadata for OpenEnv lives in [openenv.yaml](/home/casp1an/Code/TradeX1/openenv.yaml). It describes the repository as a market surveillance benchmark rather than a trading or liquidity-management environment.
